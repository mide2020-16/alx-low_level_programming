# 0x14-bit_manipulation

This repository contains C programs that demonstrate various tasks related to bit manipulation.

## List of Tasks

1. [0-binary_to_uint.c](./0-binary_to_uint.c): A function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
2. [1-print_binary.c](./1-print_binary.c): A function that prints the binary representation of a number.
3. [2-get_bit.c](./2-get_bit.c): A function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
4. [3-set_bit.c](./3-set_bit.c): A function that sets the value of a bit at a given index to 1.
5. [4-clear_bit.c](./4-clear_bit.c): A function that sets the value of a bit at a given index to 0.
6. [5-flip_bits.c](./5-flip_bits.c): A function that returns the number of bits needed to flip to get from one number to another.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mide2020-16/0x14-bit_manipulation.git`
2. Navigate to the repository: `cd 0x14-bit_manipulation`
3. Compile the desired C file: `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <output>`
4. Run the compiled program: `./<output>`

Feel free to explore and use these programs as a reference for your own bit manipulation tasks in C.
